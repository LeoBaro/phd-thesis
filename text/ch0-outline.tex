\hinttext{This is where the actual thesis begins. Explain the field of research and how your work fits in. Try to answer to the reader how your contributions provide new insights. However, keep this simple. Assume that the reader has only a very basic understanding of the field. Try to use lingo and terms that do not need to be explained. You may use forward references. But use them sparingly. You do not want the reader to frequently flip ahead 100 pages!}

\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{s:Outline}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows. 

\begin{description}

  \item[Chapter \ref{s:Gamma-Ray-Astronomy}] gives the reader the required background to understand the context of this work. \autoref{s:Gamma-Ray-Astronomy} discusses $\gamma$-ray astronomy and ground-based $\gamma$-ray imaging with Cherenkov telescopes. \autoref{s:CTA} introduces the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the science goals, an overview of the telescope array, and its associated computing and software systems, including the Science Alert Generation System. Finally, it explores the scientific use cases of serendipitous discoveries and follow-up observations linked to the real-time detection of transient events. \autoref{s:gamma-ray-data-analysis} covers gamma-ray data analysis techniques, including the full field of view maximum likelihood and the aperture photometry. It also describes the Li\&Ma significance estimation method in the context of a reflected regions background estimation algorithm. Finally, \autoref{s:Gamma-Ray-Bursts} covers the study of $\gamma$-ray bursts, the transient phenomena this work is focused on.
  
  \item[Chapter \ref{s:anomaly-detection}] introduces the concept of anomaly detection for time series analysis, discussing the major existing contributions to the field. \autoref{s:anomaly-detection} introduces the definition and properties of time series data and the concept of anomaly. It discusses the several types of techniques existing in the scientific literature, classifying them using a taxonomy. \autoref{s:ad-with-dl} focuses on anomaly detection techniques based on deep learning. The method developed in this work belongs to this category. \autoref{ss:ad-astrophysics} lists several contributions made in the astrophysics field, proving that these techniques are becoming increasingly popular for analyzing astrophysical data.


  \item[Chapter \ref{s:contribution}] presents the proposed method to address the real-time source detection problem introduced in \autoref{s:sag}. This chapter is organized as follows. \autoref{s:contribution} will describe the proposed anomaly detection technique. It presents the data pipeline that has been developed to generate input data, the deep learning architectures that have been investigated, and the training process. The evaluation of the models will be addressed in \autoref{s:Experiment-Setup}. \autoref{ss:p-values} will describe the p-value analysis to associate each positive classification with a gaussian statistical significance. \autoref{s:non-stationary-settings} will investigate several problems that can arise during the telescope observations and how those problems can affect the proposed system.
