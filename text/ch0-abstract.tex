This page is mandatory. Put a summary of your thesis here. A good abstract should fit on a single page. Until up to approximately 1.5 pages nobody will probably complain. If you hit the two pages mark, you have done something wrong.

Ideally, this abstract and the one that you submitted along with your \emph{notice of intention to submit (NOI)}\footnote{\url{https://www.latrobe.edu.au/researchers/grs/hdr/candidature/forms-and-resources}} should be identical. However, slight variations are permissible.
